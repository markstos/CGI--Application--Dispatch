3.00 Jun 16, 2011
    [FEATURES] 
    - PSGI support is improved. CGI::Application::Dispatch is now been
      rewritten and is included in this distribution. It is no longer a
      wrapper around the older dispatcher, but is completely PSGI-native.
      Performance should be improved a bit as well. 
     
    [THINGS THAT MIGHT BREAK YOUR CODE]
    As part of the significant update to PSGI support, you'll need to update a
    couple lines of code in your "dispatch.cgi" script if you were using an
    older version of CGI::Application::Dispatch::PSGI. See the section on
    "Backwards Compatibility" in that documentation.

    [INTERNALS]
    - CGI::Application 4.5 is now required for the newer native PSGI support.

    - Exceptions in CGI::Application::Dispatch::PSGI are now handled with
      HTTP::Exception.  This in turn depends on HTTP::Status, which is
      currently in a distribution which depends on HTML::Parser, which depends
      having a C-compiler available. I don't consider this ideal, as I'd like
      to be able to support the easy installation of a pure-Perl
      CGI::Application stack. This could possibly be addressed in the future by
      removing the false dependency on a C-compiler from HTTP::Status, or we
      could return to use Exception::Class directly for exception handling.

      The except format of the default thrown exceptions may change in the
      future.

2.18 Sep 9, 2010
    - Update Build.PL to require a newer version of "version", to address
      a rare installation problem. (RT#56283) Thanks to Jim Brandt and others.

2.17 Dec 30, 2009

    - Update examples to use FindBin::Real instead of FindBin, since FindBin is not 
      fully mod_perl compatible. (Mark Stosberg)
    - Fix typo in POD (Alexander Becker) 

2.16 Mar 23, 2009
    - Fix: "$app->run() error handler breaks exception objects." RT#43340 (dekimsey)
    - Documentation improvements (Dave Baker, thinc)
    - remove "Makefile.PL", which appears to related to some test failures. Build.PL
      seems to work reliably. If removing Makefile.PL is a problem for you, maybe you have
      a better solution to RT#39793: https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=39793
      (Mark Stosberg)

2.15 Dec 4, 2008
    - Logging improvement: Quit duplicating $ENV{REQUEST_URI} for Not Found requests (Mark Stosberg)
    - Logging improvement: Remove stray "'" character (Mark Stosberg)

2.14 Nov 2, 2008
    - New feature: $ENV{PATH_INFO} is now abstracted through dispatch_path(). (RT#34069, Bradley Bailey) 
    - Attempted fix for "Couldn't open t/TEST.PL" error, RT#39793. Add comments to that ticket
      if you still have "make test" problems with Apache::Test. (Puneet Kishor, Kevin, Mark Stosberg)
