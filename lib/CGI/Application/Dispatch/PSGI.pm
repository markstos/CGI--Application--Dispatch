=head1 NAME

CGI::Application::Dispatch::PSGI - Dispatch requests to CGI::Application based objects using PSGI

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=head2 Out of Box

Under mod_perl:

  # change "Apache1" to "Apache2" as needed.

  <Location />
  SetHandler perl-script
  PerlHandler Plack::Handler::Apache1
  PerlSetVar psgi_app /path/to/app.psgi
  </Location>

  <Perl>
  use Plack::Handler::Apache1;
  Plack::Handler::Apache1->preload("/path/to/app.psgi");
  </Perl>

Under CGI:

This would be the instance script for your application, such
as /cgi-bin/dispatch.cgi:

    ### in your dispatch.psgi:
    # ( in a persistent environment, use FindBin::Real instead. )
    use FindBin 'Bin';
    use lib "$Bin/../perllib';
    use Your::Application::Dispatch;
    Your::Application::Dispatch->as_psgi;

    ### In Your::Application::Dispatch;
    package Your::Application::Dispatch;
    use base 'CGI::Application::Dispatch::PSGI';


=head2 With a dispatch table

    package MyApp::Dispatch;
    use base 'CGI::Application::Dispatch::PSGI';

    sub dispatch_args {
        return {
            prefix  => 'MyApp',
            table   => [
                ''                => { app => 'Welcome', rm => 'start' },
                ':app/:rm'        => { },
                'admin/:app/:rm'  => { prefix   => 'MyApp::Admin' },
            ],
        };
    }

The C<< .psgi >> file is constructed as above.

=head2 With a custom query object

If you want to supply your own PSGI object, something like this in your .psgi file will work:

    sub {
        my $env = shift;
        my $app = CGI::Application::Dispatch::PSGI->as_psgi(
            table => [
                '/:rm'    =>    { app => 'TestApp' }
            ],
            args_to_new => {
                QUERY    => CGI::PSGI->new($env)
            }
        );
        return $app->($env);
    }


=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides a way to look at the path (as returned by
C<< $env->{PATH_INFO} >>) of the incoming request, parse off the desired module and
its run mode, create an instance of that module and run it.

It will translate a URI like this (in a persistent environment)

    /app/module_name/run_mode

or this (vanilla CGI)

    /app/index.cgi/module_name/run_mode

into something that will be functionally similar to this

    my $app = Module::Name->new(..);
    $app->mode_param(sub {'run_mode'}); #this will set the run mode

=head2 as_psgi(%args)

This is the primary method used during dispatch.

    #!/usr/bin/perl
    use strict;
    use CGI::Application::Dispatch::PSGI;

    CGI::Application::Dispatch::PSGI->as_psgi(
        prefix  => 'MyApp',
        default => 'module_name',
    );

This method accepts the following name value pairs:

=over

=item default

Specify a value to use for the path if one is not available.
This could be the case if the default page is selected (eg: "/" ).

=item prefix

This option will set the string that will be prepended to the name of the application
module before it is loaded and created. So to use our previous example request of

    /app/index.cgi/module_name/run_mode

This would by default load and create a module named 'Module::Name'. But let's say that you
have all of your application specific modules under the 'My' namespace. If you set this option
to 'My' then it would instead load the 'My::Module::Name' application module instead.

=item args_to_new

This is a hash of arguments that are passed into the C<new()> constructor of the application.

=item table

In most cases, simply using Dispatch with the C<default> and C<prefix> is enough
to simplify your application and your URLs, but there are many cases where you want
more power. Enter the dispatch table. Since this table can be slightly complicated,
a whole section exists on its use. Please see the L<DISPATCH TABLE> section.

=item debug

Set to a true value to send debugging output for this module to STDERR. Off by default.

=item auto_rest

This tells Dispatch that you are using REST by default and that you care about which HTTP method
is being used. Dispatch will append the HTTP method name (upper case by default) to
the run mode that is determined after finding the appropriate dispatch rule. So a GET request
that translates into C<< MyApp::Module->foo >> will become C<< MyApp::Module->foo_GET >>.

This can be overridden on a per-rule basis in a custom dispatch table.

=item auto_rest_lc

In combinaion with L<auto_rest> this tells Dispatch that you prefer lower cased HTTP method names.
So instead of C<foo_POST> and C<foo_GET> you'll have C<foo_post> and C<foo_get>.

=head2 dispatch_args()

Returns a hashref of args that will be passed to L<dispatch>(). It will return the following
structure by default.

    {
        prefix      => '',
        args_to_new => {},
        table       => [
            ':app'      => {},
            ':app/:rm'  => {},
        ],
    }

This is the perfect place to override when creating a subclass to provide a richer dispatch
L<table>.

When called, it receives 1 argument, which is a reference to the hash of args passed into
L<dispatch>.

    my ($self, $args) = @_;

        ],
    };
}

=head2 translate_module_name($input)

This method is used to control how the module name is translated from
the matching section of the path (see L<"Path Parsing">.
The main reason that this method exists is so that it can be overridden if it doesn't do
exactly what you want.

The following transformations are performed on the input:

=over

=item The text is split on '_'s (underscores)
and each word has its first letter capitalized. The words are then joined
back together and each instance of an underscore is replaced by '::'.


=item The text is split on '-'s (hyphens)
and each word has its first letter capitalized. The words are then joined
back together and each instance of a hyphen removed.

=back

Here are some examples to make it even clearer:

    module_name         => Module::Name
    module-name         => ModuleName
    admin_top-scores    => Admin::TopScores

=cut

sub translate_module_name {
    my ($self, $input) = @_;

    $input = join('::', map { ucfirst($_) } split(/_/, $input));
    $input = join('',   map { ucfirst($_) } split(/-/, $input));

    return $input;
}

=head2 require_module($module_name)

This class method is used internally to take a module
name (supplied by L<get_module_name>) and require it in a secure fashion. It
is provided as a public class method so that if you override other functionality of
this module, you can still safely require user specified modules. If there are
any problems requiring the named module, then we will C<croak>.

    CGI::Application::Dispatch::PSGI->require_module('MyApp::Module::Name');

Sometimes it's easiest to explain with an example, so here you go:

  CGI::Application::Dispatch::PSGI->as_psgi(
    prefix      => 'MyApp',
    args_to_new => {
        TMPL_PATH => 'myapp/templates'
    },
    table       => [
        ''                         => { app => 'Blog', rm => 'recent'},
        'posts/:category'          => { app => 'Blog', rm => 'posts' },
        ':app/:rm/:id'             => { app => 'Blog' },
        'date/:year/:month?/:day?' => {
            app         => 'Blog',
            rm          => 'by_date',
            args_to_new => { TMPL_PATH => "events/" },
        },
    ]
  );

So first, this call to L<as_psgi> sets the L<prefix> and passes a C<TMPL_PATH>
into L<args_to_new>. Next it sets the L<table>.


=head2 VOCABULARY

Just so we all understand what we're talking about....

A table is an array where the elements are gouped as pairs (similar to a hash's
key-value pairs, but as an array to preserve order). The first element of each pair
is called a C<rule>. The second element in the pair is called the rule's C<arg list>.
Inside a rule there are slashes C</>. Anything set of characters between slashes
is called a C<token>.

=head2 URL MATCHING

When a URL comes in, Dispatch tries to match it against each rule in the table in
the order in which the rules are given. The first one to match wins.

A rule consists of slashes and tokens. A token can one of the following types:

=over

=item literal

Any token which does not start with a colon (C<:>) is taken to be a literal
string and must appear exactly as-is in the URL in order to match. In the rule

    'posts/:category'

C<posts> is a literal token.

=item variable

Any token which begins with a colon (C<:>) is a variable token. These are simply
wild-card place holders in the rule that will match anything in the URL that isn't
a slash. These variables can later be referred to by using the C<< $self->param >>
mechanism. In the rule

    'posts/:category'

C<:category> is a variable token. If the URL matched this rule, then you could retrieve
the value of that token from whithin your application like so:

    my $category = $self->param('category');

There are some variable tokens which are special. These can be used to further customize
the dispatching.

=over

=item :app

This is the module name of the application. The value of this token will be sent to the
L<translate_module_name> method and then prefixed with the L<prefix> if there is one.

=item :rm

This is the run mode of the application. The value of this token will be the actual name
of the run mode used.

=back

=item optional-variable

Any token which begins with a colon (C<:>) and ends with a question mark (<?>) is considered
optional. If the rest of the URL matches the rest of the rule, then it doesn't matter whether
it contains this token or not. It's best to only include optional-variable tokens at the end
of your rule. In the rule

    'date/:year/:month?/:day?'

C<:month?> and C<:day?> are optional-variable tokens.

Just like with L<variable> tokens, optional-variable tokens' values can also be retrieved by
the application, if they existed in the URL.

    if( defined $self->param('month') ) {
        ...
    }

=item wildcard

The wildcard token "*" allows for partial matches. The token MUST appear at the end of the
rule.

  'posts/list/*'

By default, the C<dispatch_url_remainder> param is set to the remainder of the URL
matched by the *. The name of the param can be changed by setting "*" argument in the
L<ARG LIST>.

  'posts/list/*' => { '*' => 'post_list_filter' }

=item method

You can also dispatch based on HTTP method. This is similar to using L<auto_rest> but
offers more fine grained control. You include the method (case insensitive) at the end of
the rule and enclose it in square brackets.

  ':app/news[post]'   => { rm => 'add_news'    },
  ':app/news[get]'    => { rm => 'news'        },
  ':app/news[delete]' => { rm => 'delete_news' },

=back

The main reason that we don't use regular expressions for dispatch rules is that regular
expressions provide no mechanism for named back references, like variable tokens do.

=head2 ARG LIST

Each rule can have an accompanying arg-list. This arg list can contain special arguments
that override something set higher up in L<dispatch> for this particular URL, or just
have additional args passed available in C<< $self->param() >>

For instance, if you want to override L<prefix> for a specific rule, then you can do so.

    'admin/:app/:rm' => { prefix => 'MyApp::Admin' },

=head1 Path Parsing

This section will describe how the application module and run mode are determined from
the path if no L<DISPATCH TABLE> is present, and what options you have to
customize the process.  The value for the path to be parsed is retrieved from
C<< $env->{PATH_INFO} >>.

=head2 Getting the module name

To get the name of the application module the path is split on backslahes (C</>).
The second element of the returned list (the first is empty) is used to create the application module. So if we
have a path of

    /module_name/mode1

then the string 'module_name' is used. This is passed through the L<translate_module_name>
method. Then if there is a C<prefix> (and there should always be a L<prefix>) it is added
to the beginning of this new module name with a double colon C<::> separating the two.

If you don't like the exact way that this is done, don't fret you do have a couple of options.
First, you can specify a L<DISPATCH TABLE> which is much more powerful and flexible (in fact
this default behavior is actually implemented internally with a dispatch table).
Or if you want something a little simpler, you can simply subclass and extend the
L<translate_module_name> method.

=head2 Getting the run mode

Just like the module name is retrieved from splitting the path on slashes, so is the
run mode. Only instead of using the second element of the resulting list, we use the third
as the run mode. So, using the same example, if we have a path of

    /module_name/mode2

Then the string 'mode2' is used as the run mode.

=head1 MISC NOTES

=over 8

=item * CGI query strings

CGI query strings are unaffected by the use of C<PATH_INFO> to obtain the module name and run mode.
This means that any other modules you use to get access to you query argument (ie, L<CGI>,
L<Apache::Request>) should not be affected. But, since the run mode may be determined by
CGI::Application::Dispatch::PSGI having a query argument named 'rm' will be ignored by your application
module.

=back

=head1 CLEAN URLS WITH MOD_REWRITE

With a dispatch script, you can fairly clean URLS like this:

 /cgi-bin/dispatch.cgi/module_name/run_mode

However, including "/cgi-bin/dispatch.cgi" in ever URL doesn't add any value to the URL,
so it's nice to remove it. This is easily done if you are using the Apache web server with
C<mod_rewrite> available. Adding the following to a C<.htaccess> file would allow you to
simply use:

 /module_name/run_mode

If you have problems with mod_rewrite, turn on debugging to see exactly what's happening:

 RewriteLog /home/project/logs/alpha-rewrite.log
 RewriteLogLevel 9

=head2 mod_rewrite related code in the dispatch script.

This seemed necessary to put in the dispatch script to make mod_rewrite happy.
Perhaps it's specific to using C<RewriteBase>.

  # mod_rewrite alters the PATH_INFO by turning it into a file system path,
  # so we repair it.
  $ENV{PATH_INFO} =~ s/^$ENV{DOCUMENT_ROOT}// if defined $ENV{PATH_INFO};

=head2 Simple Apache Example

  RewriteEngine On

  # You may want to change the base if you are using the dispatcher within a
  # specific directory.
  RewriteBase /

  # If an actual file or directory is requested, serve directly
  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
  RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d

  # Otherwise, pass everything through to the dispatcher
  RewriteRule ^(.*)$ /cgi-bin/dispatch.cgi/$1 [L,QSA]

=head2 More complex rewrite: dispatching "/" and multiple developers

Here is a more complex example that dispatches "/", which would otherwise
be treated as a directory, and also supports multiple developer directories,
so C</~mark> has its own seperate dispatching system beneath it.

Note that order matters here! The Location block for "/" needs to come before the
user blocks.

  <Location />
    RewriteEngine On
    RewriteBase /

    # Run "/" through the dispatcher
    RewriteRule ^home/project/www/$ /cgi-bin/dispatch.cgi [L,QSA]

    # Don't apply this rule to the users sub directories.
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/~.*$
    # If an actual file or directory is requested, serve directly
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
    # Otherwise, pass everything through to the dispatcher
    RewriteRule ^(.*)$ /cgi-bin/dispatch.cgi/$1 [L,QSA]
  </Location>

  <Location /~mark>
    RewriteEngine On
    RewriteBase /~mark

    # Run "/" through the dispatcher
    RewriteRule ^/home/mark/www/$ /~mark/cgi-bin/dispatch.cgi [L,QSA]

     # Otherwise, if an actual file or directory is requested, serve directly
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d

     # Otherwise, pass everything through to the dispatcher
    RewriteRule ^(.*)$ /~mark/cgi-bin/dispatch.cgi/$1 [L,QSA]

    # These examples may also be helpful, but are unrelated to dispatching.
    SetEnv DEVMODE mark
    SetEnv PERL5LIB /home/mark/perllib:/home/mark/config
    ErrorDocument 404 /~mark/errdocs/404.html
    ErrorDocument 500 /~mark/errdocs/500.html
  </Location>

=head1 SUBCLASSING

While Dispatch tries to be flexible, it won't be able to do everything that people want. Hopefully
we've made it flexible enough so that if it doesn't do I<The Right Thing> you can easily subclass
it.

#=head2 PROTECTED METHODS
#
#The following methods are intended to be overridden by subclasses if necessary. They are not
#part of the public API since end users will never touch them. However, to ensure that your
#subclass of Dispatch does not break with a new release, they are documented here and are considered
#to be part of the API and will not be changed without very good reasons.

=head1 SECURITY

Since C::A::Dispatch::PSGI will dynamically choose which modules to use as the
content generators, it may give someone the ability to execute random modules
on your system if those modules can be found in you path. Of course those
modules would have to behave like L<CGI::Application> based modules, but that
still opens up the door more than most want. This should only be a problem if
you don't use a L<prefix>. By using this option you are only allowing Dispatch
to pick from a namespace of modules to run.

=head1 Backwards Compatibility

Versions 0.2 and earlier of this module injected the "as_psgi" method into
CGI::Application::Dispatch, creating a syntax like this:

   ### in your dispatch.psgi:
   use Your::Application::Dispatch;
   use CGI::Application::Dispatch::PSGI;
   Your::Application::Dispatch->as_psgi;

   ### In Your::Application::Dispatch;
   use base 'CGI::Application::Dispatch::PSGI';

In the current design, the C<< as_pgsi >> method is directly in this module, so
a couple of lines of code need to be changed:

   ### in your dispatch.psgi:
   use Your::Application::Dispatch;
   Your::Application::Dispatch->as_psgi;

   ### In Your::Application::Dispatch;
   use base 'CGI::Application::Dispatch::PSGI';


=head1 Differences with CGI::Application::Dispatch

=over 4

=item dispatch()

Use C<< as_psgi() >> instead.

Note that the C<error_document> key is not supported here. Use the
L<Plack::Middleware::ErrorDocument> or another PSGI solution instead.

=item dispatch_path()

The dispatch_path() method is not supported. The alternative is to reference C<< $env->{PATH_INFO} >> which is
available per the PSGI spec.

=item handler()

This provided an Apache-specific handler. Other PSGI components like L<Plack::Handler::Apache2> provide
Apache handlers now instead.

=item _http_method()

This method has been eliminated. Check C<< $env->{REQUEST_METHOD} >> directly instead.

=item _parse_path()

The private _parse_path() method now accepts an additional argument, the PSGI C<< $env >> hash.

=item _run_app()

The private _run_app() method now accepts an additional argument, the PSGI C<< $env >> hash.

=item _r()

This method has been eliminated. It does not apply in PSGI.
